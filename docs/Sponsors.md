## Partners

### BisectHosting

I would like to thank BisectHosting for sponsoring me. I would also like to recommend them, as they are the hosting provider I have used for all MiniPlaceholders tests and my personal plugins.

Also, don't forget that by using the code ‚Äú4drian3d,‚Äù you can get a 25% discount on the first month of your next server, not only for Minecraft, but for any supported game.
